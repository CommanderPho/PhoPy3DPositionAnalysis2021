        "Some neurons were lost during the recording, presumably due to electrode drift or gliosis. To establish ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ times for neurons, we used ISI contamination: when hourly % of ISIs < 3 msec was above 4%, unit was considered to be offline. Based on these 'on' and 'off' times, only units that were online for 80% of the experiment were used for analysis."

    Parameters
    ----------
    neurons : core.Neurons
        neurons for calculating stability
    window : int, optional
        window size over which isi contamination to be calculated, by default 3600
    isi_thresh : int, optional
        isi percentage threshold above which neurons are considered off in that window, by default 4 percent

    Returns
    -------
    boolean array
