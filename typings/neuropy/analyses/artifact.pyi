    calculating artifact periods using z-score measure

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : core.Signal
        neuropy.signal object
    thresh : int, optional
        zscore value above which it is considered noisy, by default 4
    edge_cutoff : int, optional
        zscore value, boundries are extended to this value, by default 2
    merge : int,
        artifacts less than this seconds apart are merged, default 5 seconds
    method : str, optional
        [description], by default "zscore"
    filt : list, optional 
        lower and upper limits with which to filter signal, e.g. 3, 3000] -> 
        bandpass between and 3000 Hz while [45, None] -> high-pass above 45.
