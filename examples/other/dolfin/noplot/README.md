# _FEniCS/dolfin_ examples without the plot() command
In this directory you will find very similar examples as in the parent directory
without using the shortcut ``plot()`` command.

git clone https://github.com/marcomusy/vtkplotter.git
cd vtkplotter/examples/other/dolfin/noplot
python example.py  # on mac OSX try 'pythonw' instead
```
