Python Notes:

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 


## Vtk Widget Notes:

This class implements one type of vtkButtonRepresentation. It changes the appearance of a user-provided polydata by assigning textures according to the current button state. It also provides highlighting (when hovering and selecting the button) by fiddling with the actor's property. Since this is a 2D version, the button is rendered in the overlay plane. Typically it is positioned in display coordinates, but it can be anchored to a world position so it will appear to move as the camera moves.


## The pyvista widget add functions (for example add_checkbox_button_widget(...) ) are defined in "WidgetHelper" class in widgets.py. 

## They are actually called on the main plotter object though, and this occurs via inheritance of WidgetHelper by BasePlotter in plotting.py:
	class BasePlotter(PickingHelper, WidgetHelper)
