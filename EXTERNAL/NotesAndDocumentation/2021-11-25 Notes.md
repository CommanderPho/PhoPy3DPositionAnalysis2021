Python Notes:

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 


## Vtk Widget Notes:

This class implements one type of vtkButtonRepresentation. It changes the appearance of a user-provided polydata by assigning textures according to the current button state. It also provides highlighting (when hovering and selecting the button) by fiddling with the actor's property. Since this is a 2D version, the button is rendered in the overlay plane. Typically it is positioned in display coordinates, but it can be anchored to a world position so it will appear to move as the camera moves.

## The pyvista widget add functions (for example add_checkbox_button_widget(...) ) are defined in "WidgetHelper" class in widgets.py. 

## They are actually called on the main plotter object though, and this occurs via inheritance of WidgetHelper by BasePlotter in plotting.py:
	class BasePlotter(PickingHelper, WidgetHelper)

# General PyVista Notes:

## Best Summary is here (also listed out below):
https://docs.pyvista.org/api/core/index.html

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK), developed by Kitware, has many mesh data types that PyVista wraps. This chapter is intended to describe these different mesh types and how we wrap and implement each of those mesh types in VTK. This chapter also highlights how all PyVista types have direct access to common VTK filters (see Filters).

All PyVista meshes inherit from the DataSet type (see Data Sets). PyVista has the following mesh types:

    pyvista.PolyData consists of any 1D or 2D geometries to construct vertices, lines, polygons, and triangles. We generally use pyvista.PolyData to construct scattered points and closed/open surfaces (non-volumetric datasets). The pyvista.PolyData class is an extension of vtk.vtkPolyData.

    A pyvista.UnstructuredGrid is the most general dataset type that can hold any 1D, 2D, or 3D cell geometries. You can think of this as a 3D extension of pyvista.PolyData that allows volumetric cells to be present. Itâ€™s fairly uncommon to explicitly make unstructured grids but they are often the result of different processing routines that might extract subsets of larger datasets. The pyvista.UnstructuredGrid class is an extension of vtk.vtkUnstructuredGrid.

    A pyvista.StructuredGrid is a regular lattice of points aligned with internal coordinate axes such that the connectivity can be defined by a grid ordering. These are commonly made from numpy.meshgrid(). The cell types of structured grids must be 2D quads or 3D hexahedra. The pyvista.StructuredGrid class is an extension of vtk.vtkStructuredGrid.

    A pyvista.RectilinearGrid defines meshes with implicit geometries along the axis directions that are rectangular and regular. The pyvista.RectilinearGrid class is an extension of vtk.vtkRectilinearGrid.

    Image data, commonly referred to as uniform grids, and defined by the pyvista.UniformGrid class are meshes with implicit geometries where cell sizes are uniformly assigned along each axis and the spatial reference is built out from an origin point. The pyvista.UniformGrid class is an extension of vtk.vtkImageData.

    pyvista.MultiBlock datasets are containers to hold several VTK datasets in one accessible and spatially referenced object. The pyvista.MultiBlock class is an extension of vtk.vtkMultiBlockDataSet.
