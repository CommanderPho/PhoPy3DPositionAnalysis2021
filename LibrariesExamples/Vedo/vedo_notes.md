## Potentially Interesting Examples:
python examples\basic\mousehighlight.py ### Enables highlighting mesh on click
basic\colorlines.py
python examples\basic\clustering.py ### Renders clusters and removes outliers automatically somehow
python examples\basic\flatarrow.py ### Renders curved arrows that are flat in a given plane

### Generated Silhouettes/Projects of a mesh to a specified plane.
python examples\basic\silhouette1.py

### Broken due to missing meshes:
python examples\basic\glyphs.py

#### Multi-state buttons (as would be used for toggling place cells)
python examples\basic\buttons.py
